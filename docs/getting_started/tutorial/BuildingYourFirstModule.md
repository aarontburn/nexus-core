# Nexus: Building your First Module

Because each module requires quite a bit of configuration, it is **highly recommended** to use one of the provided templates to start developing your module. These templates are fully functional out of the box and provide everything you need to start.



### [Nexus with React](./ReactSetup.md) 
This template utilizes Vite + React + TypeScript to your module.

### [Nexus with Vanilla TypeScript](https://github.com/aarontburn/nexus-template-vanilla-ts)

---
### [Nexus Internal Template](https://github.com/aarontburn/nexus-template-internal)
This is to create modules with no GUI, useful for monitoring, adding additional settings, or interfacing with other modules.
