# Nexus: Building your First Module

Because each module requires quite a bit of configuration, it is **highly recommended** to use one of the provided templates to start developing your module. These templates are fully functional out of the box and provide everything you need to start.


Visit the tutorial for the template you want to develop with.


### [Nexus with React **(Recommended)**](./react/1%20ReactSetup.md) 
This template utilizes Vite + React + TypeScript to build your module.

### [Nexus with Vanilla TypeScript](./vanilla/1%20VanillaSetup.md)
This template utilizes HTML + CSS + TypeScript. 

### [Nexus Internal Template](./internal/1%20InternalSetup.md)
This is to create modules with no GUI, useful for monitoring, adding additional settings, or interfacing with other modules.
