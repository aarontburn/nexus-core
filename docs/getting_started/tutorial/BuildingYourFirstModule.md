# Nexus: Building your First Module

Because each module requires quite a bit of configuration, it is **highly recommended** to use one of the provided templates to start developing your module. These templates are fully functional out of the box and provide everything you need to start.

Download one of the following templates, based on your needs and tech stacks.


### [Nexus with React](./ReactSetup.md)
