# Nexus: Prerequisites
This tutorial is assuming you already have knowledge of Node.js.


## Required Tools
### Code Editor
You will need a text editor. Nexus was developed and tested using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is what we recommend.

### Command Line
You will need access to a command line to run and export your module. Many IDEs come with an integrated terminal, but you can also use your operating systems native one.

### Node.js and npm
You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm (which should be bundled with Node.js).
