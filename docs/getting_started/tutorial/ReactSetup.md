# Nexus: React


## Project Structure
After downloading the template and running `npm install`, your project should look something like this:

```
root/
+-- node_modules/
+-- src/
    +-- process/
        +-- main.ts

    +-- renderer/
        +-- react-wrapper/
            +-- ...

        +-- index.html
        +-- renderer.ts

    +-- export-config.js
    +-- module-info.json

+-- .gitattributes
+-- .gitignore
+-- electron.ts
+-- package-lock.json
+-- package.json
+-- README.md
+-- tsconfig.json
```
Let's break down each section of the project.


### Low Maintenance Files
Starting with root files and directories that are self-explanatory, unchanged from standard Node.js projects, or will require very little configuration:

- `node_modules/`: This is where dependencies are installed.
- `.gitattributes`: Standard [git attributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).
- `.gitignore`: Standard [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
- `package-lock.json`: Standard [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json).
- `README.md`: Standard [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/.managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes). Change this to show off your module.
- `electron.ts`: This file is used to let your editor know that Electron is being used. This file is ignored and should not be modified.   
- `tsconfig.json`: Standard [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/); modified to remove `/react-wrapper/`, which is mentioned later.
- `package.json`: Standard [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json). However, this does list many commands you may be using throughout development. See the [Commands](#cli-commands) section for more information.

### The Important Stuff
By default, the `src/` folder is set up how standard MVC applications are organized, but the file structure can be modified. However, all files used by your module **need to stay within the `src/` directory.**

```
root/
+-- src/
    +-- process/
        +-- main.ts

    +-- renderer/
        +-- react-wrapper/
            +-- ...

        +-- index.html
        +-- renderer.ts

    +-- export-config.js
    +-- module-info.json
```
- `src/`: This is the folder that will be converted into your module and should contain ALL of your source code and assets.
- `src/export-config.js`: A file containing export configurations for your module. Read the [Exporting](link) section for more details.
- `src/module-info.json`: A file containing details about your module. Read the [Exporting](link) section for more details.
- `src/process/`: The directory containing all code and assets for the process (backend).
- `src/process/main.ts`: The entry point to your module and the main [Process](link). If you move or rename this file, ensure your changes are also reflected in `export-config.js` (read about [export-config.js](link)).  
- `src/renderer/`: The directory containing all code and assets for the renderer (frontend).
- `src/renderer/index.html`: A bare-bones HTML file. Because we are using React, this file **does not need to be modified**, and only contains code to host our React application. 
- `src/renderer/renderer.ts`: This file interfaces between the process and the React webpage, and its purpose is to pass data between them. You likely wonâ€™t need to modify this unless you're changing the dev server config.
- `src/renderer/react-wrapper/`: This is where your React application is stored. Within this folder is an entire Vite + React + TypeScript application.

### The React Wrapper
Within the `react-wrapper/` directory is a full Vite + React + TypeScript application using [Vite's React + TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).

```
root/
+-- src/
    +-- renderer/
        +-- react-wrapper/
            +-- node_modules/
            +-- src/
                +-- assets/
                    +-- ...

                +-- App.css
                +-- App.tsx
                +-- index.css
                +-- main.tsx
                +-- ModulesBridge.ts
                +-- vite-env-d.ts

            +-- index.html
            +-- package-lock.json
            +-- package.json
            +-- tsconfig.app.json
            +-- tsconfig.json
            +-- tsconfig.node.json
            +-- vite.config.ts
```

Here are the files that are important:
- `App.tsx`: Where your source code is located.
- `ModulesBridge.ts`: This file contains methods used to communicate with your process.
